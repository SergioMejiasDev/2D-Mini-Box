# 2D-Mini-Box
Collection of 2D minigames completely programmed by me. Here I will be collecting different games that I am doing, inspired by various arcade classics.

To navigate through the menus, you can use the arrows or the WASD keys, and select options with Enter or the space bar.

The instructions for each game are visible by pressing the "Help" button within the start menu.

I am only the author of the programming. The sprites and the SFX are not my property.

The playable game can be downloaded from https://sergiomejias.itch.io/2d-mini-box
